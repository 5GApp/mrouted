.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the friendly control tool for
.Xr mrouted 8 .
It can be used to query status, debug, restart, and kill a running
.Nm mrouted .
Commands can be abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix; for
example,
.Cm s s
for
.Cm show status .
.Sh OPTIONS
This program follows the usual UNIX command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').  The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d, -detail
Detailed output, where applicable, see each command below.
.It Fl h, -help
Show usage instructions and exit.
.It Fl p, -plain
Use plain table headings, no ANSI ctrl characters.
.It Fl t, -no-heading
Skip table headings altogether.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Nm Ar help
Show usage instructions and exit.
.It Nm Ar kill
Kill running daemon, like sending SIGTERM to
.Xr mrouted 8
.It Nm Ar debug Op ? | none | SYSTEM Op ,SYSTEM

.Pp
In this example, there are four VIFs connecting to two subnets and two
tunnels.
The VIF 3 tunnel is not in use (no peer address).
The VIF 0 and VIF 1 subnets have some groups present;
tunnels never have any groups.
This instance of
.Nm mrouted
is the one responsible for sending periodic group membership queries on the
VIF 0 and VIF 1 subnets, as indicated by the "querier" flags.
The list of boundaries indicate the scoped addresses on that interface.
A count of the number of incoming and outgoing packets is also
shown at each interface.
.Pp
Associated with each subnet from which a multicast datagram can originate
is the address of the previous hop router (unless the subnet is directly-
connected), the metric of the path back to the origin, the amount of time
since we last received an update for this subnet, the incoming VIF for
multicasts from that origin, and a list of outgoing VIFs.
"*" means that the outgoing VIF is connected to a leaf of the broadcast
tree rooted at the origin, and a multicast datagram from that origin will
be forwarded on that outgoing VIF only if there are members of the
destination group on that leaf.
.Pp
.Nm mrouted
also maintains a copy of the kernel forwarding cache table.
Entries are created and deleted by
.Nm mrouted .
.Pp
The cache tables look like this:

.Pp
Each entry is characterized by the origin subnet number and mask and the
destination multicast group.
.Pp
The 'CTmr' field indicates the lifetime of the entry.
The entry is deleted from the cache table when the timer decrements to zero.
The 'Age' field is the time since this cache entry was originally created.
Since cache entries get refreshed if traffic is flowing,
routing entries can grow very old.
.Pp
The 'Ptmr' field is simply a dash if no prune was sent upstream, or the
amount of time until the upstream prune will time out.
The 'Ivif' field indicates the incoming VIF for multicast packets from
that origin.
.Pp
Each router also maintains a record of the number of prunes received from
neighboring routers for a particular source and group.
.Pp
If there are no members of a multicast group on any downward link of the
multicast tree for a subnet, a prune message is sent to the upstream router.
They are indicated by a "P" after the VIF number.
.Pp
The Forwvifs field shows the interfaces along which datagrams belonging to
the source-group are forwarded.
.Pp
A "p" indicates that no datagrams are being forwarded along that interface.
An unlisted interface is a leaf subnet with no members of the particular
group on that subnet.
.Pp
A "b" on an interface indicates that it is a boundary interface, i.e.\&
traffic will not be forwarded on the scoped address on that interface.
An additional line with a
.Sq \*(Gt
as the first character is printed for
each source on the subnet.
.Pp
Note that there can be many sources in one subnet.

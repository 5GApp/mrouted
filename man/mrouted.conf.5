.Sh NAME
.Nm mrouted.conf
.Nd mrouted configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/mrouted.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In many cases you do not need to configure
.Nm mrouted .
It configures itself automatically to forward multicast on all
multicast-capable interfaces, i.e., interfaces that have the
.Cm IFF_MULTICAST
flag set, excluding the loopback interface.  It locates other DVMRP
capable routers directly reachable via those interfaces.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width TERM -compact -offset indent
.It Nm mrouted
will not start with less than two enabled virtual interfaces (VIFs).  A
VIF is either a physical multicast-capable interface or a tunnel.
.It Nm  mrouted
will log a warning if all of its VIFs are tunnels; such a configuration
is likely better replaced by more direct (GRE) tunnels (i.e. eliminate
the middle man).
.El
.Pp
To override the default settings, for example to to add tunnel links to
other DVMRP routers, configuration commands may be placed in
.Pa /etc/mrouted.conf .
There are five types of commands:

.It
.Cm cache-lifetime
.Ar <SEC>

.Cm name
.Ar boundary-name | scoped-addr Ns / Ns Ar mask-len

.Pp
The file format is free-form: whitespace (including newlines) is not
significant.  The
.Dq #\&
character marks start of a comment to end of line.
.Pp
The
.Cm boundary
option to all commands can accept either a name or a network boundary;
the
.Cm boundary
and
.Cm altnet
options may be specified as many times as necessary.
.Pp
The
.Cm cache-lifetime
is a value that determines the amount of time that a
cached multicast route stays in kernel before timing out.
The value of this entry should lie between 300 (5 min) and 86400 (1 day).
It defaults to 300.
.Pp
The
.Cm name
option assigns names to boundaries to make configuration easier.
.Pp
The
.Cm igmp-query-interval
setting controls the IGMP query interval used when this router is
elected querier on a LAN.  It can be set to any value in the range
1-1024, inclusive.  However, it is not recommended to go below 10 sec.
Default: 125.
.Pp
The
.Cm igmp-robustness
setting controls many aspects of IGMP timers.  It can be any value in
the range 2-10, inclusive.  The query-response-interval used below is
hard-coded to 10 sec in
.Nm mrouted :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -indent
.It Group Membership Timeout
Number of seconds before
.Nm mrouted
determines that there are no more members of a group on a LAN.  Formula:
(igmp-robustness x igmp-query-interval) + (1 x query-response-interval)
.It Other Querier Timeout
Number of seconds before
.Nm mrouted
determines there is no longer an elected querier on the LAN.  Formula:
(igmp-robustness x igmp-query-interval) + (0.5 x query-response-interval)
.It Last-member Query Count
Number of group-specific queries sent before
.Nm mrouted
assumes there are no local members of a group.  The number of queries is
equal to the value of the robustness variable.  However,
.Nm mrouted
currently hard-codes this to 2
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm phyint
command can be used to disable multicast routing (or enable if
.Nm mrouted
is started with all interfaces disabled) on the physical interface
identified by local IP address
.Ar local-addr ,
or to associate a non-default metric or threshold with the specified
physical interface.
The local IP address
.Ar local-addr
may be replaced by the interface name (e.g. le0).  If an interface is
attached to multiple IP subnets, describe each additional subnet with
the
.Cm altnet
keyword.
.Nm mrouted
supports all IGMP versions and defaults to use IGMP v3.  Use
.Cm igmpv2
or
.Cm igmpv1
to force compatibility modes on the
.Cm phyint .
.Pp
.Sy NOTE:
All
.Cm phyint
commands must precede tunnel commands.
.Pp
The
.Cm pruning
command is provided for
.Nm mrouted
to act as a non-pruning router.  This is no longer supported and the
configuration option is only kept for compatibility reasons.
.Pp
The
.Cm tunnel
command can be used to establish a tunnel link between local IP address
.Ar local-addr
and remote IP address
.Ar remote-addr ,
and to associate a non-default metric or threshold with that tunnel.
The local IP address
.Ar local-addr
may be replaced by the interface name (e.g. le0).
The remote IP address
.Ar remote-addr
may be replaced by a host name, if and only if the host name has a single
IP address associated with it.
The tunnel must be set up in the mrouted.conf files of both routers before
it can be used.
.\"For backwards compatibility with older versions of
.\".Nm mrouted ,
.\"the srcrt keyword specifies
.\"encapsulation using IP source routing.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width TERM -compact -offset indent
.It Cm boundary
allows an interface to be configured as an administrative boundary
for the specified scoped address.
Packets belonging to this address will not be forwarded on a scoped interface.
The boundary option accepts either a name or a boundary spec.
.It Cm metric
is the "cost" associated with sending a datagram on the given interface
or tunnel; it may be used to influence the choice of routes.  The metric
defaults to 1.  Metrics should be kept as small as possible, because
.Nm mrouted
cannot route along paths with a sum of metrics greater than 31.
.It Cm rate-limit
allows the network administrator to specify a certain bandwidth in kbps
which would be allocated to multicast traffic.  It defaults to 500 kbps
on tunnels, and 0 (unlimited) on physical interfaces.
.It Cm threshold
is the minimum IP time-to-live required for a multicast datagram to be
forwarded to the given interface or tunnel.  It is used to control the
scope of multicast datagrams.  (The TTL of forwarded packets is only
compared to the threshold, it is not decremented by the threshold.
Every multicast router decrements the TTL by 1.)  The default threshold
is 1.
.El
.Pp
In general, all DVMRP routers connected to a particular subnet or tunnel
should use the same metric and threshold for that subnet or tunnel.
.Sh EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
This is an example configuration for a mythical multicast router at a big
school.
